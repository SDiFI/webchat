# SDiFI Webchat

This is the webchat widget for the SDiFI project. It requires a working instance
of a [Masdif](https://github.com/sdifi/masdif/) server.

In development. Expect breakage.

## Usage

The Webchat widget is published both as a React component and a standalone UMD
bundle.

### React component

To use the component in your project add it as a dependency:

```
yarn add @sdifi/webchat
```

The `react` and `react-dom` packages are peer dependencies, so if you don't
already have those add them as dependencies in your project:

```
yarn add react react-dom
```

Example usage:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import Chat from '@sdifi/webchat';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Chat serverAddress="http://localhost:8080" title="Jóakim" subtitle="Aðalönd" />
    </div>
  );
};

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!);
root.render(<App />);
```

### Standalone UMD bundle

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@sdifi/webchat@0.3.0/dist/webchat.umd.production.min.js"></script>
    <script>
    window.onload = () => {
      Webchat.init("root", {
        serverAddress: "http://localhost:8080",
        title: "Jóakim",
        subtitle: "Aðalönd",
      });
    }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Speech input

Currently the speech recognition input is provided by a direct client side
connection to the gRPC-Web service at `speech.tiro.is` and final results are
POSTed as text messages to the conversation. The server address is not
configurable, as the plan is to add ASR to
[Masdif](https://github.com/sdifi/masdif/). We use
[grpc-nice-web](https://github.com/deeplay-io/nice-grpc/tree/master/packages/nice-grpc-web#using-ts-proto)
with TypeScript code generated by
[ts-proto](https://github.com/stephenh/ts-proto). The code is generated from the
Protobuf definitions in [Tiro Speech
Core](https://github.com/tiro-is/tiro-speech-core/tree/master/proto) and rarely
change, so the generated code is committed to version control.

## Development workflow

1. Have a running [Masdif](https://github.com/sdifi/masdif/) server.
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn start &`
4. `cd example && yarn install && yarn start`
5. Go look at http://localhost:1234 hot reload while editing the code

To just build minified (and not minified) bundles do:

```
yarn build
```

This will create TypeScript typedefs, a CommonJS
(`dist/webchat.cjs.production.min.js`), ESM (`dist/webchat.esm.js`) and a
standalone UMD bundle (`dist/webchat.umd.production.min.js`).

## Publishing new versions

1. Update the `version` field in [package.json](./package.json). Try to follow semver.
2. `git add package.json && git commit -m "Update version to X.Y.Z" && git tag -a vX.Y.Z`
4. `yarn install`
5. `yarn publish --access public --new-version X.Y.Z`
